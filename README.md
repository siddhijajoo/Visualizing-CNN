# Visualizing-CNN

In this project, we explore the visual patterns learned by image classification models, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Using the ResNet50V2 model trained on the ImageNet dataset, we employ the Activation Maximization method to visualize features learned by arbitrary filters in different layers of the network. Our goal is to synthesize input pattern images that maximize the activation of specific filters in selected layers (e.g., conv2_block1_1_conv, conv5_block1_1_conv, conv5_block3_3_conv). These synthesized images provide insights into the patterns that the filters respond to, offering a deeper understanding of the model's internal representations. Additionally, we present results using another technique, Deep Generator Network- Activation Maximization method, to further enhance feature visualization. The repository includes code for feature visualization, along with visualization results and interpretations, providing a comprehensive exploration of CNN visualization techniques.
